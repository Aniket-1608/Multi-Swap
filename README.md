## Introduction

  

This repository contains a smart contract implementation that facilitates the swapping of multiple tokens into a single token using the Uniswap v3 protocol. This functionality can be useful for consolidating various tokens into one for purposes such as liquidity provision, portfolio management, or simplifying token holdings.

  

## Features

  

- Swap multiple tokens into a single token in one transaction.

- Utilizes Uniswap v3's efficient and flexible swapping mechanism.

- Optimized for gas efficiency.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

  

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

- You have a web3 wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the project.

- You have some testnet or mainnet ETH for gas fees.

  

## Installation

  

To install this project, follow these steps:

  

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiswap-token.git

```

  

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash

cd multiswap-token

```

  

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

  

## Usage

  

### Boot up Local Development Blockchain with a mainnet fork

  

```bash

npx  hardhat  node  --fork  https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY}  --fork-block-number  20353402

```
### Note
The project interacts with the Uniswap V3 protocol so forking the Ethereum mainnet with the recent block is necessary to test the swapping functionality.
### Launch Frontend

  

```bash

npm  start

```

  

### Interacting with the Contract

  

After launching the frontend, you can interact with it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). First, import the test accounts from the Hardhat node. Connect to the local Hardhat network. Now you can test the functionality of swapping the tokens.

  

## Examples

  

Here are some examples of how to use the MultiSwap contract:

  

-  **Consolidating Tokens**: Swap multiple ERC-20 tokens into a single token to simplify your holdings.

-  **Liquidity Provision**: Convert various tokens into one token to provide liquidity on Uniswap or other platforms.

-  **Portfolio Management**: Streamline your token management by consolidating multiple assets into a single token.
